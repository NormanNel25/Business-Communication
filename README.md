## How we communication
The transition from academic learning to practical application in the workplace is often an eye-opening experience that pushes individuals out of their comfort zones. Moving from peer-to-peer interactions as a student to professional communications as a colleague highlights the importance of adopting a more refined and intentional tone. 
While casual slang may be commonplace among my classmates, professional environments demand clarity, formality, and respect in every interaction especially when representing your organization to external stakeholders.
One such instance where I had to exercise professional judgment and communication skills involved responding to a VIP vendor who had been locked out of his Microsoft account. He explained that he is a long-serving vendor who provides critical support to our organization both onsite and remotely and that his expired account was preventing him from accessing necessary systems. 
As a first-line service support analyst I'm only granted limited administrative privileges within Microsoft Active Directory as a result I was unable to resolve the issue by unlocking his account myself.
Recognizing the urgency of the situation, I maintained a calm and respectful tone in my correspondence, acknowledging the inconvenience while clearly explaining the constraints of my role. I informed the user that, per our internal policy and verification protocols, only his direct superior could initiate a support request to escalate the matter to our second-line support team. Shortly after my response, the vendor followed the correct procedure, and his access was successfully restored.
This experience taught me the importance of managing expectations while still demonstrating empathy. When users are experiencing technical frustrations particularly when their ability to perform time-sensitive work is impacted it's crucial to remain composed and solution focused. 
Iâ€™ve learned to provide clear guidance and reassurance, which can significantly de-escalate potentially tense situations.
Furthermore, I now understand the critical role that effective communication plays not only in resolving technical issues but also in maintaining the reputation of the service desk and, by extension, the organization. 
Every interaction whether with internal colleagues or external vendors reflects on the team's professionalism and competence. This reinforces the need to continuously refine both technical knowledge and interpersonal communication in a professional setting.
